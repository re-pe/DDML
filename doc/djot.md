kdl is a document language, mostly based on
[SDLang](https://sdlang.org)
with xml-like semantics that looks like you're invoking a bunch of CLI commands"

It's meant to be used both as a serialization format and a configuration language, and is relatively light on syntax compared to XML.

page in the Github repo. Feel free to jump in and give us your 2 cents!
