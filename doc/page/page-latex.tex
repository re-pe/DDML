Language}\label{kdl---kats-document-language}}

\leavevmode\vadjust pre{\hypertarget{description}{}}%
kdl is a document language, mostly based on
\href{https://sdlang.org}{SDLang} with xml-like semantics that looks
like you\textquotesingle re invoking a bunch of CLI commands

It\textquotesingle s meant to be used both as a serialization format and
a configuration language, and is relatively light on syntax compared to
XML.

kdl is still extremely new, and discussion about the format should
happen over on the
\href{https://github.com/kdoclang/kdl/discussions}{discussions} page in
the Github repo. Feel free to jump in and give us your 2 cents!
