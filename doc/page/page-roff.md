.SH kdl - Kat\[aq]s Document Language
.PP
kdl is a document language, mostly based on SDLang (https://sdlang.org)
with xml-like semantics that looks like you\[aq]re invoking a bunch of
CLI commands
.PP
It\[aq]s meant to be used both as a serialization format and a
configuration language, and is relatively light on syntax compared to
XML.
.SS Design and Discussion
.PP
kdl is still extremely new, and discussion about the format should
happen over on the
discussions (https://github.com/kdoclang/kdl/discussions) page in the
Github repo.
Feel free to jump in and give us your 2 cents!
